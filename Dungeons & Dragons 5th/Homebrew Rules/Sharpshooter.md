[D&D Beyond Link](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/sharpshooter)

Harsh Rule - Players cannot take the Sharpshooter feat.
Soft Rule - Players can only use a single part of the Sharpshooter feat in any given action. For example: If a player is using the cover ignoring portion, then they cannot use the extended range nor the additional damage feature.
