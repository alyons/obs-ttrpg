# Greyhawk Initiative
[D&D Unearthed Arcana Link](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UAGreyhawkInitiative.pdf)

## What is Greyhawk Initiative
Greyhawk Initiative determines turn order based on the actions any combatant wants to take.

## Why Use Greyhawk Initiative
- Randomize the turn order, granting more chaos to combat
- Nerf Dexterity
- Grant certain actions a relative speed bonus
- Grants players more focus in combat by encouraging them to assess the battlefield together and come up with a strategy so when each player takes their turn, it is usually predetermined

## Basics of Greyhawk Initiative
- Each combat is organized into rounds. In each round, a combatant takes their turn. Before the start of each round, each combatant calls out their intended actions.
- Each combatant rolls their initiative dice, in accordance with their declared actions.
- Each combatant takes their turn in _ascending_ order, starting with the lowest initiative.
- Once each combatant has gone, the round ends and the cycle replays

## Determining Turn Order
### Initiative Die
| Die | Action |
|:---:|:-------|
| d4  | Ranged attack |
|     | Ranged cantrip |
| d6  | Movement |
|     | Swap gear |
|     | Any other action |
| d8  | Melee attack |
|     | Melee cantrip |
| d10 | Cast a spell |

## Ruling Changes based on Greyhawk Initiative
### Declaring Actions
- When a combatant declares their actions, they simply need to say which actions they want to take. They do not need to specify all of the targets or sources of their actions.
- **Example:** A player with a cleric who is planning on healing a party member might declare they are taking the movement and cast a spell actions, but does not need to declare exactly which spell they are using.
### Durations
- Effects that last until the end of a given turn, instead last until the end of the round in which that turn occurs.
- Effect that last until the start of a given turn, instead last until the start of the round in which that turn occurs.
- **Example:** If an effect would last until the end of your next turn, it instead last through the current round and the next round, expiring when the round ended.

### Surprise
- Surprised combatants gained the surprised condition. A combatant with this conditions gains the following:
	- The combatant take a +10 penalty to initiative
	- The combatant cannot take reactions
	- The condition ends when the round is over in which a combatant was surprised

### Changing Actions
- You may change actions based on things happening in combat. If you do, on your turn, roll the approprite dice for the action(s) you are adding, taking half of the die value as the minimum (e.g. +d6 or at least 4 if you are adding movement to your turn)
- You may change any action for an action with a lower die value, without encurring the above penalty (e.g. using a melee attack if you were planning on casting a spell)

## Other Notes
- I would only give your players about two minutes at maximum to determine their plans. Given new players or new characters, this could be more gracious, but a part of this system I find useful is getting people to be more engaged with combat. Press the timing to make it more pertinant that they pay attention.
- I would try and limit the number of combatants, you don't want to be running ten or more monsters under this system.
- Give your players a bit of time at the beginning of combat to formulate a plan. Attack, retreat, larger plans of the like. Use this time to refamiliarize yourself with the monsters so you can make their turns quick as well.
