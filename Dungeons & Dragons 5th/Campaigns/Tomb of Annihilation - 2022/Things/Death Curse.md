# Death Curse
Understanding how Acererak’s death curse works is vital to running the adventure smoothly.

The Soulmonger was activated 20 days ago and remains active until it is destroyed. While the Soulmonger is active, the following effects are in play:

-   Any humanoid on the planet that has been brought back from the dead begins to waste away. Its hit point maximum is reduced by 20 (1 for each day the Soulmonger has been active) and decreases by 1 every midnight until the Soulmonger is destroyed. If a humanoid’s hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. Traveling to another world or plane does nothing to halt the wasting effect once it has begun.
-   A humanoid whose hit point maximum is reduced can’t increase or restore it. This is true whether the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by the Soulmonger or by some other life-draining effect, such as the touch of a wight, wraith, or similar creature.
-   If a humanoid dies anywhere on the planet, its soul becomes trapped inside the Soulmonger. Only the destruction of the Soulmonger can free the trapped soul.
-   Any spell that breathes life into the dead (including [revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify), [raise dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead), [resurrection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/resurrection), and [true resurrection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/true-resurrection)) automatically fails if cast on a humanoid whose soul is either trapped in the Soulmonger or has been devoured by the atropal (see “[Soul Devouring](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/introduction#SoulDevouring)” below).
-   The Soulmonger does not affect the workings of [speak with dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-dead) spells or similar magic. The death curse has no effect on preexisting ghosts or spirits.

#### Meat Grinder

Tomb of Annihilation can be played as written, or you can make it even more difficult by running it as a meat grinder. This mode of play is suitable for experienced players who have highly optimized characters and who don’t mind putting those characters in jeopardy for the sake of a good challenge. It is less ideal for players who are inexperienced or get anxious at the thought of losing their characters.

You must choose to run the adventure as a meat grinder from the very beginning. In this mode of play, the Soulmonger gains the power to draw characters who are close to death, and the following rule applies:

-   A death saving throw succeeds on a roll of 15 or higher (instead of 10 or higher). This effect ends when the Soulmonger is destroyed. Other rules concerning death saving throws remain unchanged.

#### [Soul Devouring](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/introduction#SoulDevouring)

The soul of any humanoid that dies while the death curse is active becomes trapped inside the Soulmonger. The soul remains there until it is consumed by the atropal or the Soulmonger is destroyed.

Once a soul becomes trapped in the Soulmonger, it’s only a matter of time before the atropal devours it. You can determine the status of a trapped soul at dawn on any given day by secretly rolling a d20. On a roll of 2 or higher, the soul remains trapped in the Soulmonger, at least until the next dawn. A roll of 1 indicates that the soul was devoured by the atropal. A creature whose soul is devoured in this horrific manner can’t be returned to life by any means, including divine intervention.

If the Soulmonger is destroyed and you haven’t been tracking the status of a particular soul trapped within, grab a handful of d20s — one die for each day the soul was trapped — and roll them together. If you roll a 1 on any of the dice, the soul was devoured before it could be set free.

Spells such as [commune](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/commune) and [divination](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/divination) can be used to determine whether a soul has been devoured or whether it’s still trapped in the Soulmonger.

How many souls must the atropal devour to become a god? It could be thousands or millions. Ultimately it’s the DM’s call, but the default assumption is that this apotheosis could take months or years.

#### [Replacement Characters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/introduction#ReplacementCharacters)

The death curse means that, for the most part, dead characters stay dead. If a character dies and there’s no reasonable way for the player to continue playing that character, you can have the player create a new character. A replacement character should be the same level as the rest of the party.

Chult attracts adventurers from all over the world, and the activation of the Soulmonger draws even more adventurers than usual to its untamed wilderness. The player characters are among the earliest to arrive, but adventurers from across the globe begin to converge in Chult as the crisis mounts. It should not be difficult to introduce new characters to replace those who have perished. A new character might be the last surviving member of a doomed expedition, a guide who has lived in Chult for years, a lone explorer seeking glory or treasure, or someone racing against time to save a loved one affected by the death curse. Work with the player to come up with a story that makes sense, given the circumstances.

#### [Ticking Clock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/introduction#TickingClock)

Tomb of Annihilation is a time-bomb adventure. In other words, time is of the essence. The characters are under pressure to find and destroy the Soulmonger quickly, since many lives depend on it.

Time pressure aside, Chult is a land ripe with adventure possibilities, and characters might be drawn by curiosity or circumstance to locations such as the garden ruin of Nangalore, the dwarven forge of Hrakhamar, or the pirate haven of Jahaka Anchorage. Such locations present dangers that, when overcome, prepare the characters for greater threats awaiting them in Omu. If the characters reach Omu too soon, they probably won’t be high enough level to survive there for long. When the characters make inquiries about Omu, paint the lost city as a terrifying place so that players feel the tension of wanting to get there quickly, but not too quickly.
