# Tomb of Annihilation
These are my campaign notes for running the [Tomb of Annihilation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa)

## Altering the Game
Tomb of Annihilation is known to not be the best campaign out of the box, so I have taken it upon myself to alter the campaign to better fit what I would want to run and be more fun for my players.

### Changes I want to make
- [ ] Starting at 3rd Level
- [ ] Work on the Hex Crawl
- [ ] Make the Sewn Sisters the final boss
- [ ] Look at Acererak as a Future Campaign

## Homebrew Rules
- [[Sharpshooter]]
- [[Greyhawk Initiative]]

## Rough Timeline
- The party starts in Neverwinter and is able to find passage to Chult
	- Why would any of them need to go to Chult?
	- Who would be able to afford such a trip?
- In Port Nyanzaru, the party gets familiar with Chult and perhaps some of the factions their.
	- Objective: Party learns of guides, and that their might be other guides to hire elsewhere
	- Objective: Party learns of merchant princes, and might wish to gain a sponsorship
	- Objective: Party learns of other jobs and might seek those to do
	- Objective: Party learns of Dinosaur Races... there is no way I am not running this if they find out
- The party begins to explore the jungle
	- What Objectives are mandatory?
	- What is the planned level for the party to hit various points of the map?
	- Given the level boost at the beginning, how long can they stay in the jungle?
- The party enters the Tomb of Annihilation
	- The long slaugh begins in earnest
