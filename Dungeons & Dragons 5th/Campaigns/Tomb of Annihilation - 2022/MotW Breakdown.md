# MotW Breakdown
[[Creating a Mystery]]

## Monster
[[Acererak]]

Primary Type: Sorcerer
Secondary Type(s): Collector, Destroyer
Goal: To consume enough souls with the Soulmonger to resurrect (?) the [[Atropal]].

### What is Acererak doing 
Acererak is trying to grant life to the Atropal, a feat which might be fruitless given the Atropal was never alive to begin with. He created a Soulmonger, an artifact which harvest the souls of all who die on the planet to feed to the Atropal, in the hopes of creating a god which he can control. He has finished his creation and is running final tests before he leaves it under the watchful eyes of the Sewn Sisters. Once his plans are in motion, he leaves the planet and most likely the plane, off to run other of his schemes and machinations.

**Note:** It might be best to treat Acererak as a Minion rather than the Monster of the Campaign. He might not even be the final fight...

## [[Countdown]]
**Day:** Mutliple factions have started to gather in Chult. While they are not necessarily there all for the same things, there is clearly something going on in the area.
**Shadows:** 
**Dusk:** 
**Sunset:** 
**Nightfall:** Many of the world's greatest adventurers and powerful entities are gone because of the Death Curse
**Midnight:** The atropal is revived into a unstoppable being of some divinity. Neither alive or dead, this being seeks to flood existence with negative energy.
