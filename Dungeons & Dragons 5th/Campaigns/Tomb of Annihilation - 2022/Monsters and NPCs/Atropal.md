# Atropal

## Special Features

### Negative Energy Connection
The shriveled umbilical cord of an atropal appears to trail off into nothingness, but in fact, it attaches to the Negative Plane. This connection gives the atropal power over death and undeath. The cord can be severed by a [vorpal sword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/vorpal-sword) or other vorpal weapon, and doing so weakens the atropal’s tie to the Negative Plane.

An atropal can summon vestiges of creatures that died in the Negative Plane, which manifest as wraiths. These servants can exist outside the Negative Plane only by the atropal’s sheer force of will, and they quickly dissipate when the atropal is destroyed.

### Undead Nature
An atropal doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
