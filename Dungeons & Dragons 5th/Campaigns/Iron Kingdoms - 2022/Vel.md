# Vel (Velturgekabin)
## Character History
### Birth and Family
Vel was born to Turlantereak and Gekazmarihelek in Hearthstone, Ord, on Cintent 13th, 595 A.R., second of five children. Her older sister, Meg, her younger brother Hek, her youngest sister Kat, and her youngest brother Hok. She has a myriad of aunts and uncles and cousins, though many of them are scattered through Ord and Cygnar, and a good number of them on the other side of Cyriss.
1. Extended Family
	1. ~8 Aunts/Uncles (not sure how many are partnered)
	2. Approx 5 cousins per partenered Aunt/Uncle
	3. Maybe 1 niece/nephew
	4. Grandparents

### Life Before Adventuring
2. What were they doing before becoming an adventurer?
	1. Grew up slightly nomadic in Ord, moving between cities with her family
	2. As things grew dire, her family travelled to Cygnar, and ended up participating in the Battle of Henge Hold. Her parents active participants, she and her siblings as refugees.
	3. Her mother passed in the fighting, leaving her father as a widower
	4. During the chaos of getting her family inside, she was separated, from them and ended up pretty near the front lines. While always tech saavy, it clicked, her Warcaster skills, and she ended up staying and helping to repair and keep some of the warjacks going which were busted up as part of the violence. She saw her mother's corpse on the battlefield.
	5. After the battle, she was listless, taking odd jobs and work throughout Cygnar until a chance encounter with her eldest sister. After getting her three younger siblings through with some of the other family members, she came to look for Vel and her parents. While she was fairly certain her mom had passed, she had found their father, who Vel had assumed dead. This was the first time, Vel had felt any emotions in plausibly a year.
	6. In reconnecting with her family, the few members who stayed on this side, she found a new vigor in life and has dedicated her time to improving jack technology. She wants jacks to get to a point of more independent thought, rather than just things to control. She now dives into mysteries, intent on solving them, to get that next piece of knowledge which will lead her to the next evolution of steam jacks.

### Current Status
3. Why did they leave that live?
	1. It was less that she left the life behind so much as it was her drive evolved to where she needed to do more exploration, and do more lucrative work, so being an adventurer fit the bill perfectly.
4. What did she leave behind?
	1. Guildmates
	2. Family (though less so, she still tries to send letters and the like to keep in touch)
5. What are her goals?
	1. Improve her steamjack
	2. Learn more about making steam jacks


Archetypes
	Primary: The Solver
		- Not just solving the immediate problem, but how to fix the underlying problem or deal with the reprecussions
		- Asking questions
		- Asking the leader for help or the other party members for things she can't supply/get/do
		- Front of investigations
	Secondary: Adventurer
		- Wants to explore
		- Upbeat (I think cautiously optimistic with a hint of pragmatism given her past)
		- Not unaware of the dangers, but I need to find things which will get me closer to my goal

HP Dice: 8, 8, 5

Physical Description:
- 3'0"
- 39 lbs.
- Hair color:
- skin color: green
Mannerisms:
- Fidgets with little tinkering trinkets when sitting still
- If stuck in boring things, wants to leave and go through notes or do real work
- Keeps time in combat, somehow that helps her fight
World View:
- The world is scarred and hurt, but it has made it through. Now is the time for recovery followed by growth. While the way people are currently is tense and can be harsh, it is much better than it was before the Claiming. If we practice what we are doing now and improve it, we can build a better future.
Pain Points:
- Stuck in the old ways: Anyone who holds on to tradition in opposition to progress is just uselss to Vel. She is willing to hear people talk about tradition in general, but when people are stubborn about what is an _obvious improvement_ (by her definition), then she can tend to tune them out.
- Those blinded by faith: While she definitely believes in Dhunia and the World Gorger, her focus is on the here and now. What is tangible, what is doable. Anyone blinded by faith is, again, a write off
Desires:
	1. Independent Steamjacks
		1. And AI core that give a personality (more like Megaman Robot Masters, not quite MMX free thought, she really hasn't even thought of that as a possiblity)
		2. An energy core which is carryable for steamjacks to make exploring with them more viable in more environments. Coal and water isn't great when spelunking or underwater... though most jacks even ignoring the boiler wouldn't be able to go under water.

Fears & Phobias:
- Being alone again: Losing her friends and family and being left by herself again. It was a greatly harrowing experience, and she has trouble doing things on her own. Daily life even was a struggle without the guild in which she practiced because of that clawing feeling of loneliness.
- Normal Cattle: they are big and dumb and she is smart and small. Not exactly a fan of them. Understands their place and usefulness. Also, something about the smell is just unsettling. Yes, the city smells _worse_, I suppose, but doesn't mean I have to like the smell of a farm.
