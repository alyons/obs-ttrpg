# Countdown
The countdown is what will happen if the mystery remains unsolved. It's broken down into six steps. The steps are not representative of real time, but metaphorical markers of the proceeding of events, given they are unmet by the hunters. As each step continues, things should get worse for the people being targeted.
- Day
- Shadows
- Dusk
- Sunset
- Nightfall
- Midnight

Day represents the open events, perhaps when the hook took place or shortly after.  
Shadows represents things starting to become unsettling, maybe as one or more people the party interacts with are harmed.  
Dusk represents the plans are set in motion.
Sunset represents the plans are revealed or perhaps fully online.
Nightfall represents the last moments in which intervention could alter the course of what is happening.
Midnight represents what would happen given no interference from anyone.
